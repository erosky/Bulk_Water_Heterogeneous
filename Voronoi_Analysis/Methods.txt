Big picture goal:

average volume of molecules as a function of distance from the substrate
before and after freezing

data will be in density as a distance from interface, d


FOR ONE SNAPSHOT:

Shells of 0.5 Angstroms (Malek)
in each shell, count how many molecules center of mass is in the shell (N_shell)

sum the voronoi volume of each of those molecules

density for that shell in N/cubic angstrom is N_shell/Voronoi_sum

------

substrate top and bottom interface = s_top, s_bot

for every atom in xyz file:
	if (z_pos > s_top) then (d = z_pos - s_top)
	if (z_pos < s_bot) then (d = s_bot - z_pos)
	
	* map d to the correct array index
	N++ and Volume+V in the corresponding shell
------


FOR A COLLECTION OF SIMULATION RUNS:

take the average density in each shell
