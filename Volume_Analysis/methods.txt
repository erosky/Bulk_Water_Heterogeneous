go to each log file
- extract from each log file just the data lines at the beginning of simulation
- extract from each log file just the data lines at the end of simulation

for each run:
- get average volume at beginning and end of simulation
- convert to N/volume
- then convert to g/cm^3




A=value in g/cm^3
then value in cm^3/mol = (1/A)*18.015

# Unit conversion function
atoms = 4096
mass_atom = 18.015/(6.02214*(10**23))
timestep = 5
def real2SI(metric, value):
	converted = 0
	# Convert from number density to g/cm^3
	if (metric == "density"):
		converted = (value * mass_atom / (10**-8)**3)
