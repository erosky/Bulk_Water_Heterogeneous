nucleation rate follows slope determined by delta v

Figure 3:
Capillary setup

Figure 4: nucleation rate as a function of 1/H follows slope determined by deltaV and contact angle

Note that confinement effect is not significant for capillary heights larger than 24A

Figure 5: Freezing locations
Air-water interface is a region of suppressed nucleation. If capillary is too narrow, there will be no pressure enhancement due to all the water being in proxmity to the air-water interface
Even in the six layer ibeam, even the confinemend enhancement in supressed by the air-water interface



Discussion: 

A - neglected terms that contribute to deviations form linear slope
B - capillary height smaller than 24A is subject to other effects besides laplace pressure
C - There is a maximum slope for contact angle 0
D - Use the slope and equations

Running 18A sandwich at -500 atm will tell us if the confinement effect remains constant with pressure, and if negative pressure still increases icen ucleation rate even in the presence of confinement.


E - Directly calculating the pressure within the capillary bridge proved to be difficult. 

F - future studies

Checklist

Confinement Effect:
(1)  -500 atm runs for each confinement height

(3) Clear comparison of freezing temperatures

Freezing location:
(1) 6 Layer freezing locations
(2) pdf of freezing locations in terms of distance from nearest air-water interface
(3) z-profile of 6 layer confinement vs 6-layer capillary (does air interface interfere with ordering from the substrate?)

Ice Nucleation Rate:
(1) Fit slope of heterogeneous line
(2) Discussion of thermodynamic values contributing to slope
(3) Delta V profile?? density profile in (cm3 molâˆ’1) along z-axis,
