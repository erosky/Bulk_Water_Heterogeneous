the purpose of this filder is to makes ure that setting up the initial configuration with the nph ensemble applied to only water vs the previous method of nph applied to "all" doesn't change the nucleation rate results.

I will set up an inital configuration for 1 atm, then run 5 freezing runs.

THE FIRST FOUR RUNS HAD AN AVG FREEZING TEMP
Average freezing temperature: 217.28375
Sigma: 1.3473788210818811

COMPARED TO THE RESULTS FROM THE INITIAL CONFIGURATION WHICH HAD
Average freezing temperature: 217.56500000000003
Sigma: 1.5844294451526286


IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THE INITIAL RESULTS ARE STILL VALID
