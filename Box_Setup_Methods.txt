Steps:

1. Graphite sheet has been made (in.graphite) --> output (data.graphite)
2. Equilibrate box of water at desired pressure and starting temp (in.water_box) --> output (data.liquid_MODEL_PRES)
3. Add graphite sheet to water box and equilibrate (in.configuration) --> final output (data.graphite_MODEL_PRES)



Things to check:

- Inital density of water box is reasonable
- Potential files are accurate
- XY axes are fixed
- Force on Graphite atoms are fixed when water in introduced


Extra Notes:

- Same graphite sheet goes in for all pressures
