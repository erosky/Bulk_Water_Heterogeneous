potential between ML-mW and Carbon - should it be the same interaction as with mW or do we need to redo some optimization to get a certin contact angle for ML-mW

Will the contact angle change between the two models?
they have the same mass. Would it depend on interfacial free energy values?

Starting with mW model freezing rates?
then move to ML

1 kcal/mol = 0.043 eV

Steps:
1 - setup carbon slab
2 - equilibrate box of water, save configuration
3 - delete center area, insert carbon, equilibrate again, save configuration


Determining expected freezing enhancement
For mW water on a sheet of graphene, Lupi saw a 12 K increase in freezing temperature, cooling at a rate of 1 K/ns.
Expect maybe a range of 5 to 20 K enhancement 
For mW I cooled 215 to 195 for 1 atm, -500 atm
215 to 200 at -1000 atm

Homogeneous avg freezing temps
1 atm - 203 K
-500 atm - 204 K
-1000 atm - 205 K


195 -- 215
200 -- 220
Aim for 208 - 223, 1 atm
So, cool from 225 to 205 K

mW water density - 0.033 N/A^3 (1 atm, 220 K)


First trial run froze at what seems too be 216.5K, if everthing worked correctly.


------------------
For ML-mW model,
First guess is that the temperature increase will be roughly the same as for mW, therefore look for a freezing temperature in a 5 to 20K enhancement

in homogeneous case, we used
225 - 205 K for 1 atm
230 - 210 K for -500 atm
230 - 215 K for -1000 atm

Homogeneous avg freezing temps
215K at 1 atm
219K at -500 atm
223K at -1000 atm

For graphite, we might expect freezing in the range
220 - 235 K for 1 atm
224 - 239 K for -500 atm
228 - 243 K for -1000 atm


For heterogeneous case, we can start by trying the above ranges for the cooling gradient.

I have started by not modifying the two body potential between ML molecules and carbon. I did change the three body angle to match the value of the MLmW potential.
The first test run at 1 atm from 235K to 220 K did not have an ice nucleation event. This is surprising.

I ran a second test run from 230 to 210 K. This trial froze at 220K, just 5K above homogeneous temp compared to 14K for mW


At 235K:
-500 atm MLmW water has density of ~0.0320 #/A**-3
-1000 atm MLmW water has density of ~0.0310 #/A**-3

setting up input configurations for -500 and -1000 atm MLmW graphite runs
When verifying that the system is in equilibrium (stable PE and MSD) -1000 looks a tiny bit questionable after equilibrating for 0.5 ns
I am trying an equilibrations period of 1 ns and will see how the plots look. OUtcome: Cavitation occurred. Box exploded.

The test_2 run of MLmW at 1 atm, with x and y axes fixed, had freezing take place at ~226 K
for next test I will do 235 - 215
maybe for production runs I can use a 15K range of 230 - 215, depending on the results of the next test run
