potential between ML-mW and Carbon - should it be the same interaction as with mW or do we need to redo some optimization to get a certin contact angle for ML-mW

Will the contact angle change between the two models?
they have the same mass. Would it depend on interfacial free energy values?

Starting with mW model freezing rates?
then move to ML

1 kcal/mol = 0.043 eV

Steps:
1 - setup carbon slab
2 - equilibrate box of water, save configuration
3 - delete center area, insert carbon, equilibrate again, save configuration


Determining expected freezing enhancement
For mW water on a sheet of graphene, Lupi saw a 12 K increase in freezing temperature, cooling at a rate of 1 K/ns.
Expect maybe a range of 5 to 20 K enhancement 
For mW I cooled 215 to 195 for 1 atm, -500 atm
215 to 200 at -1000 atm

Homogeneous avg freezing temps
1 atm - 203 K
-500 atm - 204 K
-1000 atm - 205 K


195 -- 215
200 -- 220
Aim for 208 - 223, 1 atm
So, cool from 225 to 205 K

mW water density - 0.033 N/A^3 (1 atm, 220 K)


First trial run froze at what seems too be 216.5K, if everthing worked correctly.
