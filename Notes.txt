potential between ML-mW and Carbon - should it be the same interaction as with mW or do we need to redo some optimization to get a certin contact angle for ML-mW

Will the contact angle change between the two models?
they have the same mass. Would it depend on interfacial free energy values?

Starting with mW model freezing rates?
then move to ML

1 kcal/mol = 0.043 eV

Steps:
1 - setup carbon slab
2 - equilibrate box of water, save configuration
3 - delete center area, insert carbon, equilibrate again, save configuration


Determining expected freezing enhancement
For mW water on a sheet of graphene, Lupi saw a 12 K increase in freezing temperature, cooling at a rate of 1 K/ns.
Expect maybe a range of 5 to 20 K enhancement 
For mW I cooled 215 to 195 for 1 atm, -500 atm
215 to 200 at -1000 atm

Homogeneous avg freezing temps
1 atm - 203 K
-500 atm - 204 K
-1000 atm - 205 K


195 -- 215
200 -- 220
Aim for 208 - 223, 1 atm
So, cool from 225 to 205 K

mW water density - 0.033 N/A^3 (1 atm, 220 K)


First trial run froze at what seems too be 216.5K, if everthing worked correctly.

For ML-mW model,
First guess is that the temperature increase will be roughly the same as for mW, therefore look for a freezing temperature in a 5 to 20K enhancement

in homogeneous case, we used
225 - 205 K for 1 atm
230 - 210 K for -500 atm
230 - 215 K for -1000 atm

Homogeneous avg freezing temps
215K at 1 atm
219K at -500 atm
223K at -1000 atm

For graphite, we might expect freezing in the range
220 - 235 K for 1 atm
224 - 239 K for -500 atm
228 - 243 K for -1000 atm


For heterogeneous case, we can start by trying the above ranges for the cooling gradient.
